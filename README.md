# Synchronization
This project was done when I was working in Trimble at Nantes as trainee. My project is to validate the time received data from different IMU sensors on different hardware such as Raspberry Pi, Up board, Udoo x86. 
## BNO055 
BNO055 is an already fusion and filtered IMU sensor that has a data rate of 100 Hz. For more info, https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/BST_BNO055_DS000_12.pdf
## MPU9255
MPU9255 is a cheap IMU sensor that give non filtered data.
